# JavaScript Frameworks Assignment 1
Small React site describing an upcoming project, available [here.](https://github.com/freddiekaplan-cme/js-frameworks-week-3). Using the useState hook to loop through different articles or showing them all.

## What I Used
- App
- CSS
- Imports
- React
- UseState
- Vite

## What I Learned
This was my first introduction to React, so plenty to get used to. I kind of got the hang of the useState hook. Exports and Imports felt like a gamechanger, so efficient. Using Vite was easy and worked great.
